## Smart Contracts

Transactions in a blockchain are a very basic contract - One party sends resources to another.
In the Ethereum blockchain, transactions can support any kind of logic. They have the expressive
power of a Turing-Complete machine - meaning they can be steps for a task that a computer can do.

As a piece of code that sits on the blockchain, a smart contract can automate tasks.
When an account receives money it can automatically distribute it to others.
This is entirely transparent so all the nodes(miners) can see what logic is being executed.


## Blockchain Technologies

Two of the most common technologies used are :
- Ethereum
- Hyperledger

### The Ethereum Blockchain

The Ethereum blockchain is an open-sourced blockchain that is a distributed computing platform and contains an operating system which supports smart contracts. Ethereum was inspired by Bitcoin. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, a developer and researcher 
who also worked on the development of bitcoin. Ethereum provides a decentralized turing-complete virtual machine. 
This virtual machine can execute smart contracts on the system.
Ether is the cryptocurrency that is generated by the Ethereum network.
It is used as the 'Gas' which runs smart contracts.
